# NLP for Depression Detection in University Students

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **web-based mental health tool** that utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to detect and evaluate depression among university students. By providing students with customized journaling prompts, the tool allows for the early identification of depression and offers tailored support to enhance mental well-being.



## Abstract

Depression affects approximately **30.6%** of university students, leading to significant challenges in academic performance and overall quality of life. Traditional detection methods, such as self-reported surveys, often fall short due to their invasive and biased nature. This project proposes a secure and user-friendly tool that leverages NLP to analyze student journal entries, providing timely feedback and interventions for mental health support.

## Objectives

- **Develop a Tool:** Create an NLP-based system for early depression detection among university students.
- **Evaluate Existing Methods:** Assess the effectiveness of current depression detection approaches.
- **Analyze NLP Potential:** Investigate the benefits and limitations of NLP in monitoring depression.
- **Implement Model:** Develop and validate a tailored NLP model for processing student-written expressions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition:** 
   - Utilize datasets from sources such as **Kaggle**, **Figshare**, and **IEEE Dataport**.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and prepare data using techniques like **tokenization**, **stemming**, and **lemmatization**.
  
3. **Model Training:**
   - Fine-tune the **RoBERTa-large** model specifically for detecting signs of depression in textual data.
  
4. **Model Validation and Testing:**
   - Employ hold-out validation techniques to evaluate model effectiveness.

## Features

- **Guided Journaling Prompts:** Customized prompts that address unique university stressors.
- **NLP Analysis:** In-depth analysis of journal entries to identify linguistic patterns associated with depression.
- **Personalized Feedback:** Tailored suggestions for self-care and mental health resources.

## Limitations

- The tool is **not intended for clinical diagnosis**.
- Targeted solely at **university students**.
- Ethical considerations regarding the use of AI-driven analysis will be taken into account.

## Future Work

- Investigate integration with existing mental health services and support systems.
- Address potential biases present in AI algorithms.
- Expand the project's scope to include diverse populations and cultural contexts.
